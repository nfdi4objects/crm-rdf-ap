# CIDOC-CRM in RDF Application Profile

> Guidelines how to use CIDOC-CRM in RDF for interoperability

This is work in progress. Contributions and comments are very welcome!

The guidelines are written in Markdown with [quarto](https://quarto.org/) in file [`index.qmd`](index.qmd) of repository <https://github.com/nfdi4objects/crm-rdf-ap> and published automatically at <https://nfdi4objects.github.io/crm-rdf-ap/>.

The repository further contains two RDF files:

- [cidoc-crm.rdf](cidoc-crm.rdf) adjusted CIDOC-CRM ontology
- [skos.rdf](skos.rdf) a copy of SKOS ontology
- [time.ttl](time.ttl) a copy of Time Ontology
- [geo.ttl](geo.ttl) a copy of GeoSPARQL Ontology
- [bibo.ttl](bibo.ttl) a copy of Bibliographic Ontology
