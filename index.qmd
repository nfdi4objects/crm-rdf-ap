# Introduction

## Background and Motivation

The [CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM)](https://www.cidoc-crm.org/) is a conceptual data model used in the cultural heritage domain. The [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) is a graph-based data format. Both CRM and RDF have been created independently for integration of information. RDF is a good fit to express CRM in data and it has been used to do so. The expression of CRM in RDF is not trivial though, so some guidelines are needed. This document is going to provide an application profile to best use CRM in RDF for integration with other RDF data within NFDI4Objects. The document is going to be compared and aligned with similar recommendations such as @Doerr2020.

## Difficulties in expressing CRM and RDF

CRM defines abstract types of entities (CRM classes) such as events, measurements, places, and actors with relationship types (CRM properties) to connect instances of these entity types. RDF and its most common extensions define how to identify entities (resources), entity types (RDF classes) and relationship types (CRM properties) with URIs and values with Unicode strings (RDF literals) optionally having a language or a data type to encode values such as numbers and dates. RDF is used with ontologies that define RDF classes, properties, and constraints. CRM looks like an ontology or like it could directly be mapped to an RDF ontology, but this is not the case. CRM is agnostic to data formats: CRM classes are not RDF classes and CRM has no concept of data types and values, so any expression of CRM in RDF comes with choices of design. It is possible to express the same information modeled with CRM in different forms of RDF, so data cannot be integrated flawlessly.

The document is managed in a git repository at <https://github.com/nfdi4objects/crm-rdf-ap>. Contributions and feedback is very welcome!


# Primitive values

[E59 Primitive Value] and its subclasses are not expressed as RDF classes. Instead

- instances of [E62 String](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E62) are expressed as RDF literals with optional language tag, and

- instances of [E60 Number](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/E60) are expressed as RDF literals with numeric data type such as `xsd:integer`

The CRM classes [E61 Time Primitive], [E94 Space Primitive], and [E95 Spacetime Primitive] are both subclasses of [E59 Primitive Value] and of [E41 Appellation], so [the latter](#e41-appelation) can be used when a mapping to established RDF data types is not applicable.

## Temporal data

Instances of [E61 Time Primitive] and [E52 Time-Span] SHOULD be expressed as RDF literals with one of the following data types:

- `xsd:date`
- `xsd:time`
- `xsd:dateTime`
- `xsd:dateTimeStamp`
- `xsd:gDay`
- `xsd:gMonthDay`
- `xsd:gMonth`
- `xsd:gYear`
- `xsd:gYearMonth`
- `edtf:EDTF` for more complex values, such as intervals or uncertain dates, in [EDTF] syntax
  - `edtf:EDTF-level0`
  - `edtf:EDTF-level1`
  - `edtf:EDTF-level2`

~~~{.ttl #lst-temporal-primitives}
@prefix edtf: <http://id.loc.gov/datatypes/edtf/>
@prefix unit: <http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/> .

<TitanticSinking> a crm:E81_Transformation ;
  crm:P124_transformed <RMSTitanic> ;
  crm:P123_resulted_in <TitanticWreck> .
  crm:P4_has_time-span 
    "1912-04-15"^^xsd:date ,                        # date only
    "1912-04-15T02:38–05:18Z"^^xsd:dateTimeStamp ,  # precise date and time with timezone
    "1912-04-15"^^edtf:EDTF .                       # imprecise date with EDTF
~~~

Support of simple temporal data is included in most SPARQL processors although it is not part of the SPARQL 1.2 specification (see [proposal SEP-0002](https://github.com/w3c/sparql-dev/blob/main/SEP/SEP-0002/sep-0002.md)).

More complex temoral data can be expressed with the [Time Ontology] as discussed by @Nys2018. EDTF can be mapped to Time Ontology via [EDTF in RDF]

::: {.callout-node}

@Doerr2020 recommend to use additional properties for temporal intervals ([E52 Time-Span]):

- `P81a_end_of_the_begin` together with  `P81b_begin_of_the_end` instead of [P81 ongoing throughout]
- `P82a_begin_of_the_begin` together with `P82b_end_of_the_end` instead of [P82 at some time within]

The use of these properties may lead to false assumption of precision and it introduced a solitary solution to a problem also addressed outside of CIDOC. For this reasons these additional properties should *not* be used in favour of EDTF and/or Time Ontology.

:::

An example: 

~~~{.ttl}
<WW1> a crm:E52_Time-Span , time:TemporalEntity .
  edtfo:hasEDTFDateTimeDescription "1914/1918" ;
  time:hasBeginning [ time:inXSDgYear "1914"^^xsd:gYear ] ;
  time:hasEnd [ time:inXSDgYear "1918"^^xsd:gYear ] .
~~~

Temporal CRM properties such as [P86 falls within] should also be replaced by corresponding properties from Time Ontology such as [time:intervalIn].

[Time Ontology]: https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/
[EDTF in RDF]: https://periodo.github.io/edtf-ontology/
[time:intervalIn]: https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/#time:intervalIn

[EDTF]: https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/
[P81 ongoing throughout]: http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/P81
[P82 at some time within]: http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/P82
[P86 falls within]: http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/P86

## Geographic data

Instances of **[E94 Space Primitive]** should be expressed using [GeoSPARQL] Ontology as instance of `geo:hasGeometry`, compatible with various geographic data formats (WKT, GeoJSON, GML...).^[See also CRM Geo draft at <http://www.cidoc-crm.org/extensions/crmgeo/>, defining superclasses of `geo:Geometry`.] CRM Property [P168 place is defined by] should be expressed with RDF property `geo:hasGeometry`. CRM Properties [P171 at some place within], and [P172 contains] can be used as RDF properties to link places ([E53 Place]) to outer and inner geometries but `geo:hasBoundingBox` and `geo:hasCentroid` should be preferred, if applicable.

~~~ttl
<TitanticWreckLocation> a crm:E53_Place ;
  crm:P89_falls_within <AtlanticOcean> ;
  geo:hasGeometry [ a geo:Geometry ;
    geo:asGeoJSON '{"type": "Point","coordinates": [-49.946944,41.7325,-3803]}' ;
    geo:asWKT "POINT (-49.946944 41.7325 -3803)" ;
  ] .
~~~

GeoSPARQL properties `geo:hasMetricSpatialResolution` and/or `geo:hasSpatialAccuracy` can be used to indicate level of detail.

# Authority files and types

CRM class **[E32 Authority Document]** and CRM property **[P71 lists]** MUST NOT be used in RDF but corresponding SKOS RDF classes [ConceptScheme] and [inScheme] instead.

CRM also defines class **[E55 Type]** with properties **[P127 has broader term]** and **[P127i has narrower term]**. The class MUST NOT be used in RDF. Instead it can be mapped to one of:

- `skos:Concept` and `skos:broader`/`skos:narrower`, or to
- individual RDF classes, connected with `rdfs:subClassOf`, or
- a more specific sublass or more generic superclass of [E55 Type], such as [E56 Language] and [E28 Conceptual Object].

Applications MAY define [ConceptScheme] as subclass of [E31 Document], [Concept] a subclass of [E27 Conceptual Object] and [inScheme] as subproperty of [P67 refers to].

[P127 has broader term]: http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/P127
[P127i has narrower term]: http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/P127i_has_narrower_term

# CRM Classes to use with caution

## E58 Measurement Unit

Defintion of instances of [E58 Measurement Unit] should be avoided but either taken from an established vocabulary of units such as QUDT or expressed as RDF value with UCUM datatype.^[See [cdt:ucum](https://ci.mines-stetienne.fr/lindt/v4/custom_datatypes#ucum) and [QUDT](https://qudt.org/).]

~~~ttl
@prefix unit: <http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/> .
@prefix cdt: <https://w3id.org/cdt/> .

<TitanticSinking>
  crm:P191_had_duration [ a crm:E54_Dimension ;
    crm:P90_has_value 160 ; crm:P91_has_unit unit:MIN ;   # value and QUDT unit
    rdf:value "7 min"^^cdt:ucum                           # UCUM string
  ] .
~~~

## E41 Appellation

**[E41 Appellation]** and its subclasses ([E35 Title] and [E42 Identifier]) should be avoided (see [above](#primitive-values) for additional subclasses [E61 Time Primitive], [E94 Space Primitive], and [E94 Space Primitive]), unless a name cannot uniquely be identified with a sequence of Unicode characters and an optional language tag:

~~~ttl
<RMSTitantic>
  crm:P102_has_title "RMS Titanic"@en ;
  crm:P1_is_identified_by [
    rdfs:value "MGY" ; 
    crm:P2_has_type <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q353659> # call sign
  ] .
~~~

If there are multiple names with one preferred name per language and optional name alias, use `skos:prefLabel` and `skos:altLabel`:

~~~ttl
<RMSTitantic>
  skos:prefLabel "RMS Titanic"@en ;
  skos:altLabel "Titanic"@en, "Royal Mail Steamship Titanic"@en .
~~~

The RDF property `skos:prefLabel` should not be confused with [P48 has preferred identifier] to be used for identifiers only. 


If information about the act of naming is required, use [E13 Attribute Assignment] for simple appelations or [E15 Identifier Assignment] for identifiers.

If an identifier **[E42 Identifier] is an URI** meant to identify an RDF resource, dont use plain strings but resource URIs in RDF.  If a resource happens to have multiple equivalent URIs, choose a preferred URI and use `owl:sameAs` to record aliases:

~~~ttl
  <RMSTitantic> a crm:E18_Physical Thing ;
  owl:sameAs
    <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3018259> ,
    <http://kbpedia.org/kko/rc/RMS-Titanic-TheShip> .
~~~

instead of 

~~~ttl
<RMSTitanic> a crm:E18_Physical Thing .
  crm:P1_is_identified_by
    [ a crm:E42_Identifier ;
      crm:P190_has_symbolic_content "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3018259" ] ,
    [ a crm:E42_Identifier ;
      crm:P190_has_symbolic_content "http://kbpedia.org/kko/rc/RMS-Titanic-TheShip" ] .
~~~

# Deprecated CRM classes

CRM is constantly evolving, so some CRM classes have been renamed or replaced. Outdated classes and properties MUST be supported nevertheless to integrate data that has already been published.

See @CRMResources for a list of CRM versions.

# Differences to the official encoding of CRM in RDF

An official encoding of CRM in RDF is published since version 7.1.2, managed at <https://gitlab.isl.ics.forth.gr/cidoc-crm/cidoc_crm_rdf/> (@Doerr2020). The encoding of CRM in RDF described in this document differes by introduction of SKOS:

- [E55 Type] has been replaced by [Concept] and the latter is defined subclass of [E28 Conceptual Object]
  (instead of defining [Concept] a subclass of [E55 Type]).

- [E32 Authority Document] has been replaced by [ConceptScheme] and the latter is defined subclass of [E31 Document]

- [P71 lists] has been replaced by [inScheme] and the latter is defined subproperty of [P67 refers to].

- [P172 has broader term] has been replaced by [broader]
  (instead of defining the former superproperty of the latter)

- [P172i has narrower term] has been replaced by [narrower]
  (instead of defining the former superproperty of the latter)

In addition the use of non-standard temporal properties such as `P81a_end_of_the_begin` and `P82b_end_of_the_end` will likely be discouraged in favour of [Time Ontology] and [EDTF].

Rationales: integration with terminologies and simplification of queries.
